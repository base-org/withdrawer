# withdrawer

Golang utility for proving and finalizing ETH withdrawals from op-stack chains.

### Installation

```
go install github.com/base-org/withdrawer@latest
```

### Usage

#### Step 1

Initiate a withdrawal on L2 by sending ETH to the `L2StandardBridge` contract at `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010`, and note the tx hash.
Example on Base Goerli: [0xc4055dcb2e4647c37166caba8c7392625c2b62f9117a8bc4d96270da24b38f13](https://goerli.basescan.org/tx/0xc4055dcb2e4647c37166caba8c7392625c2b62f9117a8bc4d96270da24b38f13).

**_Note: Do not send ERC-20 or other tokens to this address, only native ETH is supported._**

**_Note: Users are required to wait for a period of seven days when moving assets out of Base mainnet into the Ethereum mainnet. This period of time is called the Challenge Period and serves to help secure the assets stored on Base mainnet._**

#### Step 2
Prove your withdrawal:
```
withdrawer --network base-mainnet --withdrawal <withdrawal tx hash> --rpc <L1 RPC URL> --private-key <L1 private key>
```
or use a ledger:
```
withdrawer --network base-mainnet --withdrawal <withdrawal tx hash> --rpc <L1 RPC URL> --ledger
```

Example output:
```
Proved withdrawal for 0xc4055dcb2e4647c37166caba8c7392625c2b62f9117a8bc4d96270da24b38f13: 0x6b6d1cc45b6601a30646847f638847feb629221ee71bbe6a3de7e6d0fbfe8fad
waiting for tx confirmation
0x6b6d1cc45b6601a30646847f638847feb629221ee71bbe6a3de7e6d0fbfe8fad confirmed
```

#### Step 3
After the finalization period, finalize your withdrawal (same command as above):
```
withdrawer --network base-mainnet --withdrawal <withdrawal tx hash> --rpc <L1 RPC URL> --private-key <L1 private key>
```

Example output:
```
Completed withdrawal for 0xc4055dcb2e4647c37166caba8c7392625c2b62f9117a8bc4d96270da24b38f13: 0x1c457f1992f48f1f959ceaee5b3c7e699a26f6f05d93997d49dafe703fd66dea
waiting for tx confirmation
0x1c457f1992f48f1f959ceaee5b3c7e699a26f6f05d93997d49dafe703fd66dea confirmed
```
